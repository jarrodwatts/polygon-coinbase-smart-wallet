## Using this Repository

I have written a full tutorial on how to build this application from scratch. [Read the tutorial](TODO)!

To get started locally:

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository.

2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

3. Create a [thirdweb API key](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) on the thirdweb dashboard.

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following: `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your-thirdweb-client-id-goes-here`.

5. On the [page.tsx](./src/app/page.tsx) file, set what chain you want to use (from the list of [supported chains](https://www.smartwallet.dev/FAQ#what-networks-are-supported)). **Note**: You need to add a **credit card** to your thirdweb account _if_ you want to use mainnet chains. To use testnets such as `baseSepolia`, you don't need to add a credit card.

   ```tsx
   // The default is polygon mainnet, which requires a credit card on your thirdweb account.
   import { polygon } from "thirdweb/chains";
   const chainToUse = polygon;
   ```

6. For mainnet use, configure [paymaster rules](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/account-abstraction) on the thirdweb dashboard.

7. Run the application with `pnpm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
